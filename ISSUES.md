4/3/2023

Changes:

-uploaded website to github - enfored HTTPS

automatic with github pages!

(BACK UP POLICIES):

-Website files saved on OneDrive

I uploaded the websites folder (includes html, css, imgs, ect) to Onedrive. For extra layers of protection,
I uploaded the website to my person oneDrive and then my Eagles Email oneDrive. I have an authenticator for both,
so not just anyone will be able to have access to these files. 

-Website files saved physically on Hard Drive

I bought a 32 gb sanddisk flash drive from bestbuy yesterday. The website folder is now saved on it, zipped up, and password protected.
Even if someone gets their hands on the flash drive, it should be encrypted.
